This Project looks to explore in an impactful manner how social interaction has changed over time.

(1) Using AR, you can visit the webpage which will activate your device camera: JuanRojasPaez.github.io

(2) Using the markers under the 'Markers' folders, place the markers infront of the device with the activated camera and explore the different images.
